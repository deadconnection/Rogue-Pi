          <h2>2. Sky WiFi Roaming Account Registration
          </h2>
          <p>2.1 To register for a Sky WiFi Roaming Account and have access to the WiFi Service you must either be over the age of thirteen (13) years of age or, if you are not yet thirteen (13), have the consent of a parent or guardian to do so. If your parent or guardian subsequently withdraws consent for you to use your Sky WiFi Roaming Account or access the WiFi Service you must immediately stop using your Sky WiFi Roaming Account until you are permitted to in accordance with this Contract.
          </p>
          <p>2.2 To create a Sky WiFi Roaming Account you will need to complete the online registration form. The personal data that you provide in the course of doing so will be collected by Sky WiFi and used to enable Sky WiFi to provide the Sky WiFi Roaming Service (and any WiFi Service you connect to which Sky WiFi is the Service Provider of) to you. For more information about the personal data which Sky WiFi collects and how it may be used please click here to view our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>2.3 Where you use your Sky WiFi Roaming Account to access a wireless internet service that a Venue Owner is the Service Provider of, Sky WiFi will share your personal data with the Venue Owner so that it can provide the wireless internet service to you. Prior to accessing the Venue Owner&rsquo;s wireless internet service you will be provided with a link to the Venue Owner&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions which govern the provision of that service to you and a link to the Venue Owner&rsquo;s Privacy Policy to set out the purposes which the Venue Owner may use your personal data for.
          </p>
          <p>2.4 By ticking the box to accept the Sky WiFi Roaming Service Terms and Conditions and submitting the registration page (and each time thereafter when you log-in to your Sky WiFi Roaming Account to access the WiFi Service at a Hotspot) you are confirming that you are over the age of thirteen (13) or have obtained the consent of a parent or guardian (if you are not yet thirteen (13)) to use the WiFi Service and that you agree to use the WiFi Service in accordance with this Contract.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h2>3. Access to the WiFi Service
          </h2>
          <p>3.1 To access the WiFi Service at most Hotspots you will need to log-in to your Sky WiFi Roaming Account. At certain Hotspots we have activated functionality which enables a returning User to automatically connect to the WiFi Service at a Hotspot so that you may perform functions or use applications on the Device which require internet access (i.e. sending emails, making phone calls, etc.). However, depending on the device type and the Hotspot capability, you may need to open a browser and click &ldquo;Go&rdquo; for your device to have full access to the internet. At a limited number of Hotspots you may access (where the 1-click access method is enabled) the WiFi Service by accepting these Terms and Conditions and clicking &ldquo;Go&rdquo; on the Landing Page.
          </p>
          <p>3.2 Access to the WiFi Service at most Hotspots is free but restrictions (including but not limited to the length of connection time available to you) apply at a limited number of Hotspots which operate on a PAYGO basis. Details of how the PAYGO WiFi Service operates are set out in clause 6 of this Contract. You can find the location of all of the Hotspots (including those where the Venue Owner provides the wireless internet service and which you are permitted to use in accordance with this Contract) on either the App or our Website.
          </p>
          <p>3.3 You agree that we may modify, restrict, suspend or temporarily cease providing access to the WiFi Service at any time in order to test the operation of a Hotspot or the Sky WiFi Network or to carry out maintenance, technical repair, enhancement or emergency work. Accordingly part (or all) of the Sky WiFi Network may not be available or fully operational at all times, and the speed, quality and availability of the WiFi Service may vary between Hotspots as a result.
          </p>
          <h2>4. Use of the WiFi Service
          </h2>
          <p>4.1 You agree to use the WiFi Service to access e-mails and instant messaging, browse the internet, use apps on the go and comply at all times with our Acceptable Use Policy which is set out below and forms part of this Contract. The WiFi Service will not support the download or transfer of excessive data via bit torrent clients and should not be used for this purpose, or any commercial or business purpose, nor should you offer for sale or provide access to the WiFi Service to any third party.
          </p>
          <p>4.2 The Account Holder is the person responsible for the security and proper use of the Sky WiFi Roaming Account (and the Devices(s)) deemed to be using the WiFi Service and the person to which notices about changes to the WiFi Service or this Contract will be sent so you must ensure that the personal information relating to the Account Holder is accurate at all times (including removing devices that are linked to your account which you no longer own). If you know or suspect that your account has been compromised, or a breach of security in relation to the WiFi Service or the Sky WiFi Network has occurred, you must notify us immediately by contacting 
            <a href="mailto:wifiuser@sky.uk">wifiuser@sky.uk
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>4.3 We operate a Network Management Policy (details of this are provided below) that may impact your use of the WiFi Service from time to time, including limiting the type of website that you can access. To protect the Sky WiFi Network and maintain quality of service we may temporarily or permanently control or restrict your online activities if such activities may have a detrimental effect on other customers&#39; quality of service (e.g. sending &quot;spam&quot; messages, hosting a website, using bit torrent clients, etc.). If we consider it necessary to take this action we will notify you before taking the action, if it is practicable to, or otherwise as soon as possible thereafter.
          </p>
          <p>4.4 You agree to reimburse us for all reasonable losses, liabilities, costs (including legal costs) and expenses which we may incur either directly or if a third party make a claim against us, which arises from, or in connection with, your misuse of the WiFi Service (or any &nbsp;actions or omissions of any person you have authorised to access (or not taken reasonable steps to prevent that person from accessing) the WiFi Service via your Sky WiFi Roaming Account) or breach of this Contract.
          </p>
          <p>4.5 If, we do not, for whatever reason, exercise our rights or remedies under this Contract following a breach by you this shall not constitute a waiver by us of those rights or remedies nor shall it relieve you from complying with your obligations (including remedying, where possible, in accordance with this Contract any breach committed by you).
          </p>
          <p>4.6 You acknowledge that your use of the WiFi Service is entirely at your own risk and that we cannot guarantee the secure transmission of your data. Accordingly we recommend that whilst using the WiFi Service, particularly if you transmit sensitive personal information (such as bank details, etc), you take steps to secure your data, for example using secure technology such as a virtual private network or a personal firewall.
          </p>
          <h2>5. Content
          </h2>
          <p>5.1 Within the App, and on the Landing Page, we may provide you with access to Sky owned content (such as Sky News, the Sky Sports Football Score Centre, etc.) and present marketing messages or offers in respect of certain products, services or features provided by Sky WiFi or other entities within the wider Sky group. You agree that neither Sky WiFi nor Sky (where applicable), shall have any liability to you for the accuracy of such Content and that your use of the same is entirely at your own risk.
          </p>
          <p>5.2 From time to time we may display within the App and/or on the Landing Page, marketing messages or offers in respect of some of our business partners, however neither Sky WiFi nor Sky (if applicable), shall be responsible for the accuracy of any information displayed in respect of its business partners, nor shall Sky WiFi or Sky (if applicable) be considered to be endorsing any products, services or features relating to its business partners.
          </p>
          <p>5.3 The Content displayed within the App and on the Landing Page is protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights. You agree not to copy, store, adapt, modify, distribute, publish, or otherwise make available such Content to any third party and acknowledge that any unauthorised use of the same may give rise to a claim against you for damages and/or be a criminal offence. Where additional terms and conditions apply in relation to any Content you should read these carefully before using or accessing it.
          </p>
          <h2>6. The PAYGO WiFi Service
          </h2>
          <p>6.1 The purchase price (and any tax, including VAT which may be payable in respect of the PAYGO Service) together with the relevant access period will be set out on the payment pages via the Landing Page. To access the PAYGO WiFi Service you will need to enter the required details into the order form displayed on the payment pages and then click &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo;. Once you have clicked &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo;, we will confirm that the order has been accepted and provide a receipt of payment by email to the Account Holder.
          </p>
          <p>6.2 The access period will commence from the time that you click &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; and so you acknowledge that by doing so you will waive your statutory right (under the Consumer Contract Regulations 2013) to cancel the order prior to the supply of the PAYGO WiFi Service to you by us. Your access to the PAYGO WiFi Service will terminate automatically upon the expiry of the access period you purchased in your Order. If you have any problems with the PAYGO WiFi Service you should contact 
            <a href="mailto:wifiuser@sky.uk">wifiuser@sky.uk.
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>6.3 If you wish to cancel your order after we have begun supplying the PAYGO WiFi Service you may cancel your order within 14 days of the date of purchase, by serving a cancellation notice either by email (to wifiuser@sky.uk) or, by post (to Sky WiFi User Support Team, The Cloud Networks Limited, 1st Floor, 4 Victoria Square, Victoria Street, St Albans, Hertfordshire AL1 3TF) and we will refund (using the same means of payment you used when you placed your order) the payment we received from you less an amount which is proportionate to the supply of the PAYGO WiFi Service we made prior to the cancellation of your order.
          </p>
          <p>6.4 If you access the wireless internet service at a Hotspot which a Venue Owner is the Service Provider of and that service operates on a PAYGO basis, please check the Venue Owner&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions for details of how that service operates as Sky WiFi is not responsible for that service.
          </p>
          <h2>7. Changes to the WiFi Service or this Contract
          </h2>
          <p>7.1 You acknowledge that Sky WiFi provides the WiFi Service to you on an ongoing basis but that Sky WiFi cannot foresee what changes may arise or be required in the future and so we may vary either the WiFi Service or this Contract accordingly. Unless the change is to your material disadvantage (in which case we will notify you in accordance with clause 7.3 below), or Sky otherwise decides that a user should be notified by post or email, notice of all other changes will be provided to you by placing a notice on the Website so you should check the Website regularly for updates. You agree that Sky shall not be obliged to notify you of changes by post or email if you only access the WiFi Service at Hotspots where the 1-click access method is enabled and you have not created a Sky WiFi Roaming Account.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>7.2 We expect that the most likely reasons for needing to vary the WiFi Service or change or add to this Contract are as follows:&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>7.2.1&nbsp;If we change, alter, improve or add to the WiFi Service or the Sky WiFi Network;
          </p>
          <p>7.2.2 If we change the way we provide our products and services (either for technical, operational or business reasons);
          </p>
          <p>7.2.3 To improve the security and operation of our technical infrastructure and to prevent misuse of the WiFi Service;
          </p>
          <p>7.2.4 If we are required to in order to satisfy any legal or regulatory obligations; or
          </p>
          <p>7.2.5 To make this Contract clearer and easier to understand or to reflect changes in consumer law (or other applicable laws).
          </p>
          <p>7.3 If we make a change to the WiFi Service or Contract which is to your material disadvantage we will send you notification (either by post or email, which Sky shall decide at the relevant time) of the change at least 31 days before the change takes effect, except where the change is required to be made immediately for valid security, legal or regulatory reasons in which case we will notify you as soon as possible after having made the change. Accordingly the Account Holder must ensure that all account information (including its email address) is accurate and up-to-date.
          </p>
          <p>7.4 Sky WiFi may increase the number of Hotspots within the Sky WiFi Network however you acknowledge that the location of the Hotspots may change from time to time and that we make no guarantee to you under this Contract that the Hotspots will be available or maintained for any particular length of time because the decision as to whether the WiFi Service is provided at each Hotspot is made by the owner of it. If the location of Hotpots changes we will update the Website and the App as soon as we are reasonably able to.
          </p>
          <p>7.5 Where we make a change to this Contract, and you continue to use your Sky WiFi Roaming Account (and any WiFi Service which Sky WiFi provides to you) after the change takes effect, you will be deemed to have understood and accepted the change, and the Contract (as amended) will govern your use of the Sky WiFi Roaming Account and any WiFi Service which Sky WiFi provides to you until we or you terminate this Contract. If you do not accept any change which we have made then you should stop using your Sky WiFi Roaming Account (and any WiFi Service which Sky WiFi provides to you) and/or terminate this Contract by sending us notice in accordance with clause 8.2 of this Contract.
          </p>
          <p>7.6 Sky WiFi may transfer its right and obligations under this Contract to any Affiliate, or company, firm or person provided that doing so will not adversely affect your rights under this Contract. This Contract is personal to you and so any transfer by you of your rights and obligations under this Contract will not be valid or recognised by us. Except as stated above no third party shall benefit from this Contract.
          </p>
          <h2>8. Duration of this Contract and Termination
          </h2>
          <p>8.1 This Contract shall commence from the moment that you click the &ldquo;Finished&rdquo; button on the registration page (and thereby confirm your intention to use your Sky WiFi Roaming Account and any WiFi Service which Sky WiFi provides to you in accordance with this Contract) and continue until either we or you terminate this Contract as set out below.
          </p>
          <p>8.2 You may terminate this Contract at any time by sending us a notice either by email (to wifiuser@sky.uk) or, by post (to Sky WiFi User Support Team, The Cloud Networks Limited, 1st Floor, 4 Victoria Square, Victoria Street, St Albans, Hertfordshire AL1 3TF). Upon receipt of your notice we will terminate your account (and if applicable, refund any payments which you may be due).
          </p>
          <p>8.3 We may terminate this Contract (and your access to your Sky WiFi Roaming Account) as follows:
          </p>
          <p>8.3.1 at any time, by giving you 31 days&rsquo; notice in writing (either by post or email, which Sky shall decide at the relevant time);
          </p>
          <p>8.3.2 immediately by giving you notice in writing (either by post or email, which Sky shall decide at the relevant time) if;
          </p>
          <p>8.3.2.1 we consider you have committed or may be committing any fraudulent or criminal activity against another person by using the WiFi Service or any other wireless internet service you may access via your Sky WiFi Roaming Account;
          </p>
          <p>8.3.2.2 you breach any term of this Contract (though for non-serious breaches we will suspend your access to the WiFi Service and give you seven (7) days to remedy the breach before we exercise such right);
          </p>
          <p>8.3.2.3 you or anyone you may authorise us to deal with on your behalf acts in a way which we reasonably consider to be inappropriate and sufficiently serious to justify ending this Contract; or
          </p>
          <p>8.3.2.4 our authority to operate as a public communications provider is suspended for any reason.
          </p>
          <h2>9. Liability of Sky WiFi under this Contract
          </h2>
          <p>9.1 Sky WiFi (or any Affiliate that provides the WiFi Service on Sky WiFi&rsquo;s behalf in accordance with this Contract) will not be liable to you for:

          </p>
          <p>9.1.4 any charges incurred, or transactions entered into, with any third party (including Hotspot owners) unless caused by us;
          </p>
          <p>9.1.5 the suspension or termination by us of access to the WiFi Service or to particular Hotspots in accordance with this Contract;
          </p>
          <p>9.1.6 delay or failure to provide the WiFi Service (or part of it) caused by an event outside our reasonable control;
          </p>
